# Pooper the BatMUD's BatClient Plugin

## Description

**Note:** 
*This plugin works, but is heavily under development.
Most, if not all bcs scripts are third-party scripts, I've might or might not found useful,
but still decided to include them in the plugin.*

This plugin provides a simple, but modular-ish way to create and manage complex-ish triggers ans somesuch.
It is designed to make the batmud clients output less poop and more like what one might be used to, when using TF.


## Installation

1. If you manage to get hands on the .jar file, copy it to batclient plugins directory.
2. If there's bcs scripts, copy them to batclient scripts directory.

## Features
* Basic Skill and Spell triggers, formatting and reporting
* Basic Combat triggers, formatting and reporting (WIP)
